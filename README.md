Delighted to share a recent milestone in my journey through HR Data Analytics! 📊 Just wrapped up an engaging project using PowerBI, courtesy of FP20 Analytics' dataset challenge. 🚀 Tackling 10 business problems while incorporating two zoom sliders on a single page was quite the adventure! 🎯 With a meticulous ETL process and a dedicated Measure Table, I was able to streamline data management and analysis. 💡 The road wasn't always smooth; there were challenges and failures along the way. But with a blend of self-motivation, AI tools, and guidance from YouTube, I powered through. 🌟 Huge shoutout to FP20 Analytics for providing this immersive challenge, giving me a taste of real-world project scenarios. 🙏

Additionally, I have created the calendar table with the help of DAX, and the main fact table is in the HR_Data table. Here, I have columns such as Age, Annual Salary, Department, Job title, Country, City, Bonus, Employee ID, ethnicity, Exit Date, Full Name, Gender, Hire Date, Latitude, and Longitude. The 10 questions addressed in the analysis are:

1. How diverse is the workforce in terms of gender, ethnicity, and age?
2. Is there a correlation between pay levels, departments, and job titles?
3. How about the geographic distribution of the workforce?
4. What is the employee retention rate trend yearly?
5. What is the employee retention rate in terms of gender, ethnicity, and age?
6. Which business unit had the highest and lowest employee retention rate?
7. Which business unit and department paid the most and least bonuses annually?
8. What is the annual historical bonus trend? Can we show new hires some statistics?
9. How about the pay equity based on gender, ethnicity, and age?
10. What is the employee turnover rate (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually) since 2017?

Attached are screenshots of the dashboards and findings: Dashboard 1, Dashboard 2, and Dashboard 3.
